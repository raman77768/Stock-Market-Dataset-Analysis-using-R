# Stock-Market-Dataset-Analysis-using-R

First we will begin examining some numerical and graphical summaries of the Smarket data, which is part of the ISLR library.
This data set consists of percentage return for the S&P 500 stock index over 1,250 days, from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2005.
For each date, we have recorded the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, Lag1 through Lag5.
We have also recorded Volume (the number of shares traded on the previous day), Today (the percentage return on the date in question) and Direction (whether the market was Up or Down on that date).
Our aim is to forecast whether the rate will go Up or Down.
